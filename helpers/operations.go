// Sa, Sb, Ss, Pa, Pb, Ra, Rb, Rr, Rra, Rrb, and Rrr implement the push_swap operations on stacks a and b. Each function modifies the stacks according to the rules of the respective operation, ensuring that the operations are performed only when valid (e.g., not trying to swap or rotate an empty stack). These functions are essential for manipulating the stacks during the sorting process in the push_swap algorithm.
